# MacTopTask

MacTopTask is a minimal macOS app written in SwiftUI. It focuses on helping you stay engaged with your most important task. The app displays your top task with a colorful 25-minute countdown timer and uses OpenAI to generate quick bullet points for completing the task.

## Features

- **Beautiful design** with bright colors and large typography
- **25-minute timer** that turns red when less than a minute remains
- **OpenAI integration** to fetch concise steps for your task

## Running the App

1. Open the `MacTopTask` folder in Xcode.
2. Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` in `OpenAIHelper.swift` with your OpenAI API key.
3. Build and run the project on macOS.

The main screen lets you enter a task, start the timer, and view AI-generated bullet points to help you finish quickly.
